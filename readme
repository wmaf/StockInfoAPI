Create a SpringBoot API that can receive requests and respond to information about publicly traded companies

Alpha Vantage API Documentation


 Alpha Vantage Get Your API Key

TestRequest / Example Data


You should be able to request a company's info by sending your API a company's stock ticker, and it will return for you an overview of their information.




STEPS:

Use the start.spring.io initializer to create a new project with the name “StockInfoAPI”
You should use maven
choose the default spring version
add the spring web dependency

Open the template project in IntelliJ and upload the starter code to GitHub
Use the VCS tab to “Share Project On GitHub”
Update application.properties
Add server.port with proper port number (ex. 4500)

Create a controllers package

Create a StockController class within the ‘controllers’ package

Implement the standard code needed for a RestController.
Add RestController annotation
Add RequestMapping annotation with “/api/stocks” as the parameter

Create a route that allows a stock ticker to be received as a RequestParam
use GetMapping to create route handler
use RequestParam annotation to store a String as ‘symbol’
the path should be “/overview”
a final example url ( http://localhost:4500/api/stocks/overview?symbol=APPL )

Use the received RequestParam to request a Stocks overview data from the requested company.
Use RestTemplate to make external HTTP requests to Alphavantage api
Hide API key in environment variable, store in application.properties
